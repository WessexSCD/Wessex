In May 2003 a group of Scottish Dancers from Andover and Winchester went to Prague for a week to dance with Czech Scottish Dancers in the City. This November five of the dancers came to England as guests of local Dancers to see some of Wessex and to dance with local Groups. The pictures show Radca, Jitca, Eva, Jana and the lone man Lucas at a dance arranged to welcome the visiting dancers to Wessex and bring together the Czechs and those who visited Prague in 2003.
