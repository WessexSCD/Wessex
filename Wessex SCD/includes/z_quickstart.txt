* Description:  This file gives instructions for how to create a basic club     *
*               website using the files in <includes/pro-forma-files>.  The     *
*               fancy stuff can be found in "z_howto.txt"                       *
*********************************************************************************

 1) Create a new directory for the club using the name "<Clubname>-new".  The 
    convention is to use a capital for the first letter of the clubname, with 
    everything else in lower case.

 2) Open "includes/pro-forma-files" and *copy!* all the files into your new club 
    folder.  Make sure you copy these files rather than moving them!  (The 
    default on my operating system is for drag-and-drop to move files)

 3) Now edit the files in your new club folder.  Make sure you are editing these 
    files and not the files in "pro-forma-files"!

 4) In your club folder, open "menu.ins" in a text editor.  Decide what your menu 
    should include, then delete the links to pages you don't want.  For a simple 
    site, you could delete the Gallery, Newsletters and Fees lines.

 5) Using page-template.php, create the pages you need to match the entries in 
    your menu.  If you're setting up a simple site, you will need a copy renamed 
    as index.php, a copy renamed as about.php, and a copy renamed as links.php. 
    You already have a page named map.php - this came over with the other pro 
    forma files.

 6) Open site-title.txt in a text editor and edit it to give the name of the 
    club.  It *must* be on the first line of the file.

 7) Open site-location.txt in your editor and change it to give the location of 
    the club.  Again, it *must* be on the very first line of the file.

 8) At this point, you should have a working site, but with no content.  Point 
    your browser at "wessex-scd.org.uk/<Clubname-new>" to view it.

 9) Now go through your pages in order and insert the required content in your 
    pages.  If you are creating a new site, you could use other club's sites for 
    ideas; or the club themselves may want to suggest content.  If you are 
    updating an older site, you can copy the content across by viewing the page 
    in a web browser, dragging your mouse across the text and pressing <Ctrl-C> 
    to copy it, and then pasting into the relevant place in the <page>.php.

10) Starting with index.php, insert the necessary content into the file.  The 
    basic page template looks terrifyingly complicated, but most of it is 
    comments.

    Before you (I?) forget, it might be good to identify the second active line 
    in the page headers:

    htmlHeader("Winchester RSCDS: this page name"); //Don't forget...(etc)...

    This needs to be changed to match your site title and page.  Do this *now*!

    There are three active lines in the lower half of the page:

    <?php insertGraphic("dancers"); ?>
    <?php insertGraphic("thistle"); ?>
    <?php	htmlFooter("file", FALSE); ?>

    The first couple of paragraphs of your main text should go immediately 
    before the <?php insertGraphic("thistle"); ?> line, while the rest should 
    go immediately after it.

    NOTE 1: Paragraphs should normally be given as <p class="indent"></p>.  A 
            quick way to do that is to global search for <newline><newline> and 
            replace with </p><newline><newline><p class="indent">.  Do this 
            before...
    NOTE 2: ...Headers should normally be given as <h3></h3>.  This will need 
            to be done manually (unless you can come up with some really clever 
            way of automatically identifying which lines are headers!)

11) When you get to map.php, the template page is pretty much as it should be - 
    except the 'where we are' line, the Google map data, and the Streetmap data
    need updating.

    Underneath the "How to find us" heading, about halfway down the page, there 
    is a snippet of text that explains how to find the venue when the map has 
    more or less got you there.  Look at some examples on other sites if you're 
    not sure what's required; then update the text for your club's venue.

    -Now go to Google Maps (https://maps.google.co.uk/).
    -Search for and find your venue on the map.
    -Google will offer you several possibilities - click on the one you want.
    -You should have a panel on the left of your screen; at the top of this will 
      be four graphic buttons, "Get directions", "My place", something that looks 
      like a printer, and a fourth one that looks like glasses - it's actually 
      three links of a chain, and is meant to stand for "link".  Click on this 
      button; you will get a little window up with two main sections in it.  The 
      lower of these is titled: "Paste HTML to embed in website".  Highlight all 
      of this text (there's lots of it, make sure you get it all!  A triple click 
      will highlight the whole thing), then copy it (<Ctrl-C> will do the job). 
    -Go back to map.php and paste the code (<Ctrl-V> if you like) into the page.  
      I like to paste it in immediately after the Google code that's already 
      there, then I've got a pattern to follow.
    -Using the comments in the file and the pattern of the code already there, 
      update your Google snippet.
    -When you're happy that you've done it correctly, delete the Google code that 
      was already in map.php.
    -Now go to Streetmap (http://www.streetmap.co.uk/) and search for your club's 
      location on that website.  Streetmap is usually happier working with a 
      postcode than with a full address.
    -When you're happy with the location, highlight and copy the URL from your 
      browser's URL bar, and paste it into the code into the page, deleting the 
      link that was there before.
    -Now view your club's site and check it's displaying OK.  If you should find 
      any faults and aren't sure what the problem is, you can always go back to 
      map.php in the pro-forma-files directory and check what you've done against 
      that.

12) Now check that the whole site displays as it should.

13) When you're happy that everything is as it should be, update "updates.txt". 
    The body of the file should mention the changes in this session (in this case, 
    you created the site).  The author line should be changed to your name and 
    contact details.  The very first line of the file will display on the website 
    as a summary of the latest changes, so this should have today's date followed 
    by a very brief summary of the latest update (e.g. "Site created").

14) A final check that everything is displaying as it should, and you're done! 
    Enjoy!
