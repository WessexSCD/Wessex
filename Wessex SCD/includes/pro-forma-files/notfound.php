/**
 * notfound.php handles any "404 Not Found" errors
 *
 * It gathers all the information it can find relating to the Not Found error.  It operates 
 * as follows:
 * - If the visitor is looking for "robots.txt", it's probably a (good) search engine 
 *    bot.  It's good to know about the visit, so we create/update a file called 
 *    "bots-log.txt" in the root directory with details of the bot's visit.  We then 
 *    set an appropriate message for the 404 page.
 * - If the visitor hasn't followed a known link, they may have typed the URL directly 
 *    into the bar at the top of the browser and made a mistake.  So let's set up a 
 *    helpful 404 message for them.
 * - If it looks like there might be a case problem, we need to flag that and add a 
 *    suitable "try this" option to the final 404 page message.
 * - If the visitor has followed a known link, then we'd better know about the problem. 
 *    So we send an email to wessex.scd@gmail.com (except during testing) and then set 
 *    up a suitable message for the 404 page.
 * Then we display the resulting page.
