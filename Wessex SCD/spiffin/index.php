// Version: 17.05.2013 17.02h
// Purpose:
//   The following page is designed to give a responsive layout and links with:
//   - "template.inc", a php file that includes functions that handle layout and code that is
//     common to most pages.  It works in conjunction with:
//   - "reset.css" which contains all the css necessary to reset browser defaults.
//   - "gallery.css" which contains all the formatting nessary if a gallery is included
//   - "normal.css" which is desgned, as far as possible, to contain *all* the formatting
//     information that is required for the site layout.  It should mean that if a change is
//     required to site layout, it should be possible to achive this for the entire site by
//     changing *only* normal.css.
//   - If including a gallery, it will also be necessary to bring in "gallery.inc".
//   See "readme.txt" (in the "includes" directory) for more information.
//---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    /* Bring in the template file from the includes directory */
    require("../includes/template.inc");
    /* Uncomment the following line if you want to include a gallery of photos */
    // require("../includes/gallery.inc");
    /* NOTE: Any pre-display php code needs to go here (e.g. setting up session variables) */
    // setvars();
    /* Now set up the heading html. This inlcudes the page title for the top of the browser bar */
    htmlHeader("Spiffin RSCDS"); //Don't forget to personalise this page title
    /* NOTE: Do not put ANY html code before this point - including comments! */
    /* Now set up the menu bar. The background is specified in the parameter
        and should be placed in the main graphics directory */
    htmlMenusFloat("tarblank.gif"); /* Change the tartan graphic if you wish.  It is expecting
                                        to find it in the main graphics directory */
